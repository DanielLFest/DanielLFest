## Who am i? ☝🥸

I am a bachelor's degree in Environmental Science with a non-defined learning route or specialization yet, 
just **_testing what really pasionates me_** 🤷‍♂️

I am learning different bunch of data-related stuff. Here there are some of my interests that i am seekking frequently:

- 🗺 Geospatial Databases/Geographic Information Systems and database management in general 
- 🏢 Data Analysis applied to Bussiness Inteligence
- 📊 Data Science (applied to whatever industry 🏭 which makes impact to people)
- 💧🌳 Water and soil sciences (Yes, it should appear at least two environmental topics on this lists 😅)

In my leasure time, a trekking lover 🚵‍♀️ and a gymbro 🏋
